38|E'FIFA Soccer 10'|E'2009-10-20'|7.6|91|E'On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction between players. In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/e4de85d163925aaf0cf7557b26808012-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

It has always been a series, under-hyped and well developed and once again it sh1ts all over CoD etc. In short, this is one of the best games out on the PS3, it is in my opinion the best FPS by a country mile and it just got even better for a third of the price of the crap churned out by treyarch et al.

Packed with the most powerful race cars - new and classic, circuit and drift - players compete to conquer the most prestigious official race tracks and championships then beyond to compete in challenging city-based competitions, and then on through to road events and urban street races. The drama, the rivalries, the aggression and the crashes; this is not a game about collecting cars or spending all of your time in the front-end tuning suspension settings or designing liveries. Codemasters wants to make racing exciting again. Gamers compete on Europe''s greatest official race tracks in prestige Marques including Aston Martin, Koenigsegg and Pagani. Iconic cities across the U.S, including San Francisco, Washington DC and Detroit - each with their own atmosphere and events - play host to diverse street races, where high-performance V8 muscle cars set the pace in aggressive, closely fought pack competitions. And in the Far East, Japanese racing culture sets the tone where night races, including Drift racing, takes drivers through neon illuminated cities and to outlying mountain roads. There''s also the opportunity to compete in races that operate on the fringes of legality in the back streets and industrial areas of Yokohama.

It had everything: smooth and clever platforming/puzzles, beautiful graphics, incredible soundtrack and unforgettable story. The characters, Farah and the prince, are some of the best i''v seen in videogames and the relashionship that grows between them during the game is one of a kind.so,Is it good today as it was back then? not entirely, but some things about it are timeless because it''s a classic game. The other two games are, arguably, not as good as the first because they don''t have the same atmosphere and innovation(The combat has improved though). none the less, these 2 games hold their own because the gameplay is better then ever and the story isn''t half bad either. The setting and background of the games are also unique and add much to the atmoshpere. I look at the first game as a work of art and the other two as ''''good enough'''' sequals but looking at this trilogy as a whole it''s almost perfect because you really can''t find a better hybrid of action, platforming, puzzles and story.  I suppose I love this trilogy more then others because I remember how it stood out against other series of games back then, attleast for me, and had me excited whenever a new game was coming out.  If you don''t mind the outdated graphics and love adventure games this trilogy is your best bet. If you have allready played the first game to the very end then, well, I guess you can just call me.....

They have appeared in many formats over the years, including two seasons of an episodic graphic adventure game series; an award-winning animated series in 1998; an online web comic in 2006, for which Purcell was awarded an Eisner Award for Best Digital Comic; and The 20th Anniversary Edition of the Surfin'' the Highway comic anthology which was nominated for a Eisner Award in 2009.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/b7665ac3dff918de707720c0171a4544-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

299|E'You Don''t Know Jack'|E'2011-02-08'|8.2|82|E'I was very hesitant to get this game, and wouldn''t have if I wasn''t stuck at home for three weeks. Owning nearly all of the previous YDKJ games on the PC, I''ve always been a huge fan, and it was the game of choice in my dorm room with friends. Upon hearing of a console release with a four-player limit, episodic format (which I remember from The Ride), and some altered mechanics to make things more fair, I had a very good feeling for this version. However, I was turned off hardcore upon discovering that the Jack Attack was based on the flash version of the game (Huh?) and that there were no gibberish questions, one of my favorite things in the previous games. I can understand not having gibberish questions in a console game, since there''s no keyboard, and typing in answers would take forever, and I''ll let that slide. So let''s run down the list of things that are important here. One, the episodic format, which you likely remember from The Ride more than anything else, is *not* based on themes. In The Ride, every "episode" had a certain theme, like alcohol, or the government, or celebrities, or something like that. It wasn''t a perfect system because right off the bat you''d know who''d have the advantage in the episode. For instance, if the episode was about computers, and one of you is a computer technician while another is a political science major with little computer experience, you know right away who''s going to win. So, while this is avoided since each episode has no specific theme, it''s still misleading to call these things "episodes" when the questions have virtually no connection. Perhaps the biggest change, though, is the way questions are answered, which is vastly different from any other YDKJ game. First of all, all players can answer, rather than a single player buzzing in and earning the prize. It''s conceivable that every single person can get the answer right, and there is no special bonus for being the first to answer. Instead, how much money you get from a question isn''t based on the question itself; all questions are worth an equal amount of money (doubled in round two), and the amount you get decreases as the clock runs down. It''s very simple: If you buzz in with 14 seconds left, you get $1400, or $2800 if it''s round two. Buzz in with two seconds left, and you get $200. All multiple-choice questions have an identical value, sans special rounds. This system actually tends to work, especially for wireless controllers, because if only one person buzzed in and answered, that person might just have the advantage of being closer to the TV, or being wired. It''s arguably a nice new mechanic that helps ease the game along. The Dis-Or-Dats have also been changed somewhat. In previous versions, there was nothing complicated about them: You had two or three choices for each word or phrase, and you picked the right one to earn money, or picked the wrong one to lose it. This version makes things a little more complicated. First, the amount of money you earn is largely based on how quickly you can answer all the items correctly, and the time left afterward is a bonus in addition to the regular value of the items. The second thing is that other players no longer totally sit out in this round, and now have a role to play. If the main player of the Dis-Or-Dat gets an item wrong, and other players buzz in the correct answer *before* the main player answers, they will all share the money earned, which is considered a "steal". It''s great that there is now an opportunity for other players to join in the Dis-Or-Dats, rather than having all but one player sit out completely.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/f4d6a96750a2bba7936d0e0069c40bdf-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

I honestly was not expecting much this season, but the improvements the devs made for this year really improve the overall gameplay. Hitting is no longer so difficult that every game is a pitcher''s duel; now hitting is easy enough on the Veteren setting as to be fun, but still realistic. I''m sure after a few games I''ll bump up the difficulty a bit and see how that goes. As for the presentation improvements, new camera angles, commentating, and cut scenes make the game look even more like a real TV broadcast. The new Postseason mode is really cool as well. The entire presentation changes to create a playoff atmosphere, and is nice for those who don''t want to play through a whole season to experience the playoffs.

Player models are - mostly - spot on. The days of having a generic batting stance or pitching mechanics for several players is long gone. Each play oozes with detail and uniqueness. Anybody who has played these games the past couple years will notice a graphical advancement, while those putting on the cleats for the first time will be spending most of their time picking their jaws off the floor. But, once again, its what Sony has done under the hood that makes this game a true standout. The new ball physics are a huge leap forward in sports games. Each ball, hit, pitch...play carries its own spin. Where and how you hit the baseball affects the spin on the ball which in turn makes each hop, bounce and hit off the bat lifelike and completely unpredictable. Your games will keep you at the edge of your seat as the game forces each ounce of your attention. A showdown in the 9th inning with the game on the line in MLB 12 is an experience unlike no other for baseball fans. Your palms will sweat. Your heart will pound as the pitcher-batter duel is refined to perfection in The Show. All this and i haven''t mentioned the all-new Diamond Dynasty mode, the best superstar creation in Road to the Show, cross-game suports for Vita and PS3, and reduced load times. This is an amazing game and a must-buy for any baseball fan!'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/98b350ef090efe24de6856b2ec5ee5db-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Flower expands the team''s tradition of delivering simple gameplay, accessible controls and a medium to explore emotional chords uncommon in video games.

Flower''s gameplay offers different experiences, pacing and rhythm to all players. Along the way, the environment will pose challenges to the players progress. Both pastoral and at times chaotic, Flower is a visual, audio and interactive escape on PS3.

Freely playing as the wind is as easy as titling the SIXAXIS wireless controller.

You start of just being able to jump, but then you get more advanced abilities like gliding, shielding, sliding, spring jumps, dancing(yes, dancing), attacks, etc. Not only that, but the only way to unlock additional content in the game is to take alternate or more difficult paths. The arcade style point based level structure of this game give it quite a bit of lasting appeal, as you have to play the levels multiple times to get more, and to get it right. The points in the levels give an extra incentive to play more, climb the leaderboards and challenge your friends. The addition of costumes and bonus hidden retro levels make it an even larger game. The only thing holding this game back from me giving it a 10 is that the levels can at times seems repetitive, but only at times, since the expanding powers, abilities and tools available keep it for the most part fresh.

There is also the new dropship in Conquest mode which spawns for the team that holds a certain flag. You can paradrop as a soldier, and even paradrop an IFV. For the new game modes, there is the classic Capture the Flag and Air Superiority.

Choose from a wide range of weapons to make your way to your primary target. Meet the fight head-on with your machine-gun, go berserk with your machete or make stealth kills as a Sniper. If you feel that the atmosphere is not warm enough, light up your flamethrower and let your enemies and everything around them feel the heat.

Worry not! This compilation in combination with ''Kingdom Hearts 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue'' offers the perfect way to catch up on the story of one of the most beloved series in gaming history up to this point for quite a decent price. There were some issues when the game first launched mainly due to the 60 frames per second upgrade (excessively fast animations, save crashes and some others); however, Square Enix have thus far been proactive on these issues -- introducing 2 patches within the last two weeks leading up to the English release proving they have indeed listened to community feedback. So far, I have had a flawless experience with this game! The 60 frames per second is smooth and works really well in this entry just as well as it did in Kingdom Hearts 2.8: Dream Drop Distance.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/38dda5f5b9a695b6fab1cab3bb25f502-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

The puzzles are pitched at just the right level that they don''t delay you too long, but you still feel clever when you work them out. However it''s the VR implementation that really shines for me - never before have I felt so in-touch with a VR world - subtle use of the controller vibration and some clever tricks really gave objects in the world a tactile sensation. I spent about 5 minutes just lifting up a dumbbell and a pot-plant trying to work out what the game was doing that made one of them "feel" heavier than the other. Outstanding. A little spooky in places but doesn''t resort to any cheap jump-scares. Give it a go, you wont be disappointed.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/94373eaa44e2a01bd429d27237dd1b33-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Playing this for the first time in VR I was honestly shocked that such an incredible experience is now possible. I would rate the game 11 if I could.

It was beautiful and fun to look at. The way the coloration is used to express the mood, how the music would change or go silent depending on what was going on in the story that was being told. All the little Easter eggs of the mans story spread throughout the areas. This game was a fun ride, very mellow and had some small puzzles to solve, but otherwise it was all about the story. I would highly recommend this game if you are looking for something that is calm, story driven and will keep you going for a good while. I played the whole story from start to end in one sitting. Very good game, i will play again to see what i may have missed.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/aeecff356c958d81b5c5a30cdbbd3c55-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Going off of telltale I have not experienced any immersion breaking graphical glitches (unlike telltale games where you will have body parts/ weapons fading through clothing etc) and the game tries to keep it so that the information you need to remember is provided within each episode (with one exception), which is handy since the business model has the episodes coming out every 2 or so months. The time travel mechanics are also very fresh (and thus unclear) and makes me wonder at the possibilities for time travel in future games.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/fc9d97a6f717679e3336fc0baf71e23e-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

850|E'Shantae: Half-Genie Hero'|E'2016-12-20'|7.5|81|E'If there were one word to describe Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, it would be magical. The atmosphere this game creates backs that statement up. If you are unfamiliar with the Shantae series, they fall under the Metroidvania genre; a 2D, exploration based puzzle platformer. The controls are tight, the music is fun, the graphics are gorgeous, and the story is charming as heck; this all makes for a masterpiece of a game. I want to touch up on the graphics a bit; simply put, this is one the most beautiful games I have ever played. On par with the games made with the Ubi Art engine (Rayman Legends, Child of Light), the style breaths life into the game. Backgrounds and platforms are beautifully hand drawn and shaded in a vector / watercolor style. Character models are drawn similarly, but with an extra dimension added to make them come alive. The game performs very well, with little slowdowns. Unfortunately it is not locked at 60 frames per second, as I encountered a few frame rate drops here and there during hectic sequences, but nothing that detracted from my experience.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/5d09bacaa9ae4cffb29fdaefe2c65b5f-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

852|E'The Invisible Hours'|E'2017-10-10'|7.2|81|E'The Invisible Hours is a masterpiece in it''s design and a must play PS VR game.  Despite being produced by a medium sized video-game company called Tequila Works, The Invisible Hours is a fully realized experience that excels in every design category.  The plot is expertly woven with well fleshed out characters and dialogue.  Meanwhile, the acting/voice work are top notch and some of the best performances I''ve seen in the video game industry.  The way everything all fits together in the game design is seriously wondrous to behold.  In addition, the game structure expertly shows off VR''s unique entertainment strengths.  The sense of presence in the game is very engrossing and one of the coolest experiences I''ve had in PS VR so far.  The world in this game is so immersive that it really feels like its happening in real time.  The atmosphere is stunning and the attention to detail is impeccable.  The controls are very simple, intuitive, and functional.  And best of all, I experienced no motion sickness the entire game.  There is no traditional gameplay per-se but it works very well here and I feel if there was, it would only get in the way of the experience. The only minor detraction I can find with the game is that sometimes it can become tiring to follow everything that happens if your mind starts to wander, but you can take a break whenever, so its not that big of a deal.  The Invisible Hours is also split up into chapters and they aren''t too long so the pacing is well done and helps with breaks.  Despite the short chapters, the game has a lot of replay as there is a bunch of content to observe and it becomes more enriching with every subsequent play-through of the events.  In conclusion, The Invisible Hours is one of the best VR experiences the medium has to offer right now and ranks up with the best video games of all time and I''m sure it will become a classic in the future!  I feel every gamer should give it a shot!'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/c1469b7e94abf4e1e19643c4669f223a-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

While the first episode seems shorter than lis 1''s first episode, that''s only because it''s way more fluid in it''s narrative. (You won''t waste hours looking at the same pointless Rachel poster.) The game does dive into the political side of America, the ugly side, and it does it well. Let''s be honest. We play the lis games for the feels,(and the cool atmosphere/music) and you will have them in the first episode. The best part is that during the entire time I''m was playing, I never once wished it was Max and Chloe on the screen.

It is designed to be an uncompromising, fast, tough and satisfying driving experience, soaked in that vertigo that stands at the core of the arcade racing genre. The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the Unreal Engine 4, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/a588724d2f6008223456e74a2a84e1be-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Essentially it''s a vry basic platformer where you create an obstacle course with random objects you are given, and only get points if you get to the end but the others don''t. It really hits that magical spot where eventually a more experienced gamer will win the most of the matches, but really everyone has an almost equal chance of victory. It reminded me a lot of the days where we played Mario Kart 64, Mario Party or Super smash bros on the N64. I downloaded this when I was home for Christmas and played it with my brothers and it filled the house again with laughter.

913|E'Life is Strange: Before the Storm - Farewell'|E'2018-03-05'|7.7|80|E'Remains one of my favorite series to date. You can actually start here before the original cause its a prequel beginning to end. But I Loved the first just a bit more, so probably start there. I feel like this was almost as great. I got the same emotional rollercoaster which I loved in the first. I just missed Max from the other game. You get emotionally attached to all the characters. Max was just so relatable to myself so she was my favorite. You will relate to one character at least because their attitudes are very realistic. This series is a beautiful experience. Every gamer should atleast try both but this game definitely gets a bit lifted up if you play the previous original first. Still great tho. And if you get the deluxe you will get an episode with Max! So go deluxe.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/43ecbefaabeccad04f2ed37676797cc3-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

There are several new features that embody this emotional experience, the most significant being the new career mode. Drivers are rewarded with a growing fanbase that''ll cheer them on, react to their every move and support them through victory. One of the new gameplay elements is the dynamic weather system. Now racing through a track can mean facing an unexpected rain storm or snow flurries in the middle of a race. This results in changing physics when powering around a corner on the wet or icy surface in Shanghai and St. Petersburg or any of the game''s 10 other locations. So, if you think driving on a dry track is boring... Flair and driving style now are just as important as technical skill, as players passing their opponent at full speed pump their fists and exhibit more emotion as they earn recognition with the revised Kudos system. The Kudos are worthwhile too, because the new A.I. personalities are be able to perform bold new driving maneuvers as they race side by side with other drivers.

Players have the freedom to follow each of the four storylines through for the ultimate character-driven experience, or they can engage in the historic battles chronologically for quick hitting action. Infinity Ward has also expanded the scope of combat to deliver a truly realistic battlefield experience. Squads now have the freedom to take on a variety of mission objectives, on expansive battlefields that allow for multiple paths and the ability to utilize actual combat tactics like outflanking and fire and maneuver capabilities. Call of Duty 2''s new engine and A.I. technology set the stage for authentic squad combat and astonishing action. Concealment can be key as battlefield smoke or even deployed smoke grenades cloud visibility. Weather effects such as the dusty sandstorms of North Africa and whiteout blizzard conditions of Russia, for example, will keep soldiers glued to their bunkers. The team has also employed a state-of-the-art Battle Chatter System that brings the action to life as squad-mates bark out context-sensitive updates in real-time to players through an advanced A.I. system.

1067|E'Nidhogg 2'|E'2018-07-19'|0.0|84|E'I only played Nidhogg briefly back in 2014 and despite me only playing the game for a brief amount of time I really enjoyed what the gameplay had to offer. In a way the gameplay was unique and it stood out quite a bit which meant returning to the game was quite easy to do. As you can imagine then I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on Nidhogg 2 and I was very excited that it was finally making its way to the Xbox One. Thankfully it was worth the wait and Ive already sunk quite a few hours into the game and the best thing is that I cant see myself getting bored of Nidhogg 2 any time soon. Once again the gameplay is a very unique experience and when you factor in the very good strategy elements as well you do end up getting addicted quite quickly. Even though the replaybility and addictiveness is quite high in the game I would still recommend that you play this game in short bursts because it does become repetetive quite quickly. I will say though that it only really became tedious and repetetive when playing on your own and without a doubt the best way to enjoy this game is when you play with friends. Playing it this way is much more fun and youll find that you end up sinking a huge amount of hours into the game without realising when you play in co-op. One thing that really impressed me about this game was the amount of customisation the game delivers to you. You can literally chop and change every little detail to your hearts content and by doing this it means that you can make every game completely different, which is great. Despite there being a huge amount of customisation available to you it doesnt really have anything different from the first game, but whilst this may be off-putting for some it didnt really bother me that much. Technically once again the game holds up really well throughout and there isnt really any problems to discuss. This is great then because no issues mean the frustration levels never get high at all and this gives you another reason to return back to the game time and time again. The presentation side of the game may not be the best youve ever seen before, but I actually really enjoyed it. Both the visuals and sound design have a unique flavour implemented into them and in a way this unique flavour makes the gameplay that little bit more fun. At the end of the day if you were a fan of the first game then youll love Nidhogg 2. It doesnt do anything spectacularly different compared to the original but what it does do is take what was so good about the first game and in a way improve it a little bit and when its all said and done it does more than enough to get a recommendation from me.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/23e5d61030548104a02e6e49052e37c7-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1070|E'Welcome to Elk'|E'2020-09-17'|0.0|84|E'Welcome To Elk is a fascinating, small-scale narrative with meta elements coming from Denmark developer Triple Topping, Welcome to Elk is a bright spot in 2020. This 2D indie introduces main character Frigg as shes arriving on Elk Island to apprentice in a woodshop for the summer. Once there, shes soon introduced to the residents and becomes enmeshed in close-knit, small-town life. Welcome to Elk is a big bag of things, though its primarily a story about storytelling. Its about how we take the bag of stories weve accumulated in our lifetime and use them as a material, like clay, to shape into things that help us survive. It''s almost like a demo built around a second-hand story that was itself second-hand. So many layers of memory and interpretation in there, so much fuzziness and imprecision it''s brilliant. The stark parts of the story get even more so and everything else gets vaguer. It''s funny and horrible and genuinely dark while Welcome To Elk remains memorable too. This is such an easy game to recommend to all gamers, without spoiling it you will either like it or love it - I''m quite confident in the fact there''s something here for nearly everyone to enjoy on their Xbox One.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/9bf86aef5dfdf2289a50aba585fdc155-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'
1071|E'Stories Untold'|E'2020-10-27'|0.0|84|E'Stories Untold is a compilation tape of four experimental adventures, including a remaster of the original episode The House Abandon.  We are about to dive in a game that received top ratings on all other platforms so Xbox fanatics get ready.. Stories Untold incorporates point-and-click mechanics and retro style backgrounds to summon back to that text-based era without feeling stale. The gameplay is easy to figure out, although younger players not used to the genre may find it awkward at first. Basically you spend much of the game looking at a monitor, whether an old television or a computer display. Puzzle-solving makes up a large portion of the game, particularly in the listening post. Here you have to periodically spin your chair around and refer to a microfilm to decode numerical messages picked up on a shortwave radio. The puzzles are cleverly designed, satisfying to solve, and complemented by a mysterious plot thats full of surprises throughout. Youre always on edge, wondering what surreal thing Stories Untold will throw at you next. While Stories Untold is not a game for everyone, and it''s short length and limited interaction make it appear more like Black Mirror''s Bandersnatch than most titles. That comparison is not quite fair, because Stories Untold goes beyond what the player expects repeatedly. Each chapter evolves and reveals a new layer of thought. There are many ways to tell a story, but Stories Untold could only be told this way. Without exposing too much about the game Id say for the price point and the fun to be exoerienced on your Xbox One, theres no reason not to add this most satisfying game to your Digital library.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/cd51d01a22084421312e7ba868d9afa2-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'
1072|E'Heroes of Hammerwatch - Ultimate Edition'|E'2020-07-31'|0.0|84|E'Heroes of hammer watch is a solid retro style designed game. It''s very reminiscent of Dungeons And Dragons for those of you that are a fan its most definately a good start. You get all the original classes though you do have to buy a few and there is what they call mercenary mode for when you max your character at lvl 20. The levels do require alot of grinding in order to grow and you have to obtain items in your dungeon runs and actually escape with them in order for you to obtain your spoils. Your goal is to grow stronger and use the materials you find to build up your guild and town. The monsters start off easy and grow quickly. In dungeon style you can aggro a few at a time or try and take on several at once. The time I have spent with the game its definitely fun and remains challenging because you dont have a large surplus of health. There is a server option so I assume multiplayer is an option but I couldnt give it a try it because no one was online playing at the times I did try. I am a huge fan of this franchise and look forward to grinding out each character to 20 and the locked ones as well. It not a die hard game, so for some it may not be their cup of tea but if your a fan of the franchise I say it''s more than good. Just be ready for some grinding and if youve not played DND before now, it would be an excellent time to introduce yourself to the genre on your Xbox One.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/b4df5136d6c45565de707e3281eccd1d-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1139|E'Ms. ''Splosion Man'|E'2011-07-13'|6.9|83|E'One analog stick and four buttons that do the same thing.  Sounds like a recipe for a really simple game.  The original Splosion man proved that wrong.  Ms. Splosion man takes the formula and builds on it in every way.  Still all you do is splode, but the levels are remarkably more complex.  The one complaint that some might have is that the game requires you to complete a sequence of moves throughout levels without any warning- ie. you''ll land on a platform only to be crushed by spikes a second later because you didn''t know to immediately jump when you landed there.  YOU WILL DIE PLAYING THIS GAME, and probably a lot.  The difficulty is much higher than the original.  That said, there are not any games anywhere near similar to this game (except for its predecessor).  A well written dialogue also makes Ms. Splosion man worth playing just to hear what she''ll say next (she''s a mixture of a ditsy high schooler and someone who quotes romance movies- its quite funny).  My one recommendation is to play Splosion Man first- it''ll be a nice warmup for this game.  That said, this game is gold from Twisted Pixel. 10/10.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/9/80e81d26dd1e87c4d59ea624f6f7988c-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

The new terrain is awesome, the new tracks and the way that you access races also makes for a good addition to FH2.

1175|E'SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE'|E'2020-07-16'|5.4|82|E'Superheat: Mind Control Delete still places you outnumbered, and outgunned. Enemies swirl around you in a storm of slow motion violence that moves at your pace. Battle after battle, each fallen foe pushes you closer to the secrets hiding in the game and each secret gives you more powers to fight the systems defenses. A familiar reflection of what the original game managed to be, but a slew of new threats, demented twists and further reinforcing of smart tactics to compensate for such unpredictability result in Superhot: Mind Control Delete ending up a great addition to the Superhot experience. While the game feels like an extension of it''s predecessor rather than a completely new experience that isn''t necessarily a bad thing. The things that were great about the 1st game are present while taking the experience to a new level. The game remains unique and keeps from feeling stale throughout. There is a very unusual ending (no spoilers) and the game will not allow you to run through again for 8 hours after completing the experience. There are ways around the 8 hour wait if you look online but I won''t go into them here. In summary SUPERHOT has another hit on their hands and this game was offered free to those that purchased the original game on their Xbox One consoles so that was quite a nice gesture and fans of the series can rejoice. If you haven''t played the series I strongly suggest checking it out as all is not what t appears to be, you might just be in for quite a great experience as a newcomer to the franchise.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/37d856f080b73a9d69e8dffdc1982b54-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

The Lord of the Games (aka LOG) is tired of the petty squabbling between Banjo and the evil witch Gruntilda (aka Grunty) over the years, and has arranged a showdown to decide the rightful owner of Spiral Mountain. Claiming to have created every video game ever made, LOG has built the game worlds in which the contest''s challenges take place. Banjo must complete LOG''s challenges to win, while Grunty tries to stop him using every method her devious mind can muster. Throughout their adventure, players create their own abilities by building vehicles for Banjo to pilot over land, water and air. Vehicle parts, which range from simple devices such as engines and wheels to more unusual equipment such as springs and egg guns, are earned and collected throughout the game. Players use their imagination to combine parts in any order to create whatever vehicle they choose. LOG''s challenges have one goal, but players'' choice of vehicle and tactics determine how they get there. By exploring worlds and solving puzzles, players both young and old are rewarded with more advanced and diverse vehicle parts in their quest to defeat Grunty once and for all. You can play through the adventure alone in the single-player campaign, or play with friends in competitive or cooperative challenges on your own or in teams.

1306|E'Gorogoa'|E'2018-05-22'|6.6|80|E'The puzzle genre has always been a genre that Ive enjoyed quite a lot over the years and Im always excited when a new game comes out into the mix. With Gorogoa I was excited more than usual and thats because Ive heard nothing but good things about it, and now I can see why. Gorogoa in my opinion is one of the best puzzle games of all time and thats no small feat because there have been many brilliant puzzle games over the years. Gorogoa blows a lot of these puzzle games out of the water for me and the main reason for that is because everything just feels so unique. The gameplay has charm oozing through it and not once did I get bored with my time with the game thanks to the excellent mechanics that had been implemented. Obviously in order to make a successful puzzle game you have to have intriguing puzzles, and thankfully theyve smashed this aspect of the game out of the park. Each puzzle has a meaning and fits in with the story and when in full flow the cleverness and uniqueness of each puzzle is absolutely fantastic. In fact the puzzles were that good that I didnt even mind getting stuck on some of them. It would however have been nice to have had a little bit more of an explanation on some of the puzzles but this only a very small gripe. I never felt the frustration levels go too high and I must admit that this is rare in a game of this ilk. One of the main reasons why the frustration levels stay low is because the controls dont cause any unnecessary problems and by keeping them responsive and fluid throughout means the game has no problems at all. Another thing that helps you stay calm and collected when things get tough is the games story. The story is very simple and is told mainly through pictures, but these pictures tell you all you need to know and in the end the story without a doubt connects with you on a number of levels. Obviously the story wouldnt be as good if it wasnt for the fantastic presentation side of the game, and to say I enjoyed this aspect of the game would be a massive understatement. Visually the game looks absolutely stunning and the hand-drawn art style gives the game a huge amount of charm. The sound design is also fantastic and when both the visuals and different sounds combine together it ends up creating a very unforgettable atmosphere. At the end of the day you know a game is absolutely brilliant when your biggest gripe is that its a little on the short side, and that really is my only gripe with Gorogoa. Everything about the game has been lovingly crafted and if youre a fan of puzzles games then you will find it very difficult to find a better puzzle game than Gorogoa.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/0eaf8b304028731366ee00613bcc5b5d-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Check it out if you like puzzle games.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/2ace989cfe245d44d52fd841cc8590b0-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'
1319|E'The Adventure Pals'|E'2018-04-03'|7.2|80|E'I love games that allow you to have enjoyable moments as a family and in my opinion there isnt enough of these types of games. The Adventure Pals is a game that people of all ages can enjoy and whilst it suffers with a few shortcomings me and my children still had a lot of fun with it, which is obviously what you want from a game. There are a few levels for you to get to grips with and I must admit that I was very impressed with the level design because each level is packed with a great deal of variety. I would however have liked a bit more content because there isnt a vast amount for you to get to grips with, but thankfully the content that is here is very enjoyable. There are a few different elements in play at the same time and most of them hold up really well. The combat is something that I especially enjoyed and the simplicity of it means that you never get frustrated which is great considering if you die you have to start from the beginning of the level again. Thankfully I didnt die that often but when I did die it was a bit of a nuisance returning back to the start of the level again. I will say though that dying is completely your fault and not the games fault because the game doesnt suffer with any technichal issues and the controls that have been implemented remain tight and responsive throughout, which is great. I would however have liked the platforming side of the game to have had a bit more work put into it because jumping and traversing can feel a little floaty and awkward which can be a bit off-putting at times. If you like silly stories then The Adventure Pals will definitely put a smile on your face. It without a doubt made me and my children laugh out loud a few times and this made us to be able to connect with the characters quite a lot. The presentation side of the game also made us connect with the characters as well and that was mainly down to how much charm the visuals and sound design had and without a doubt the colourful visuals and nice sound design add to your overall experience and in some ways they make the gameplay even more fun. At the end of the day The Adventure Pals is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed and they definitely got more right than they got wrong. It may not be the best game of its type Ive played but it does what it sets out to do and that is create a fun and enjoyable experience for the whole family and for that reason it gets a thumbs up from me.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/5684be90b16d0c55910b91427dbd0446-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1327|E'The Jackbox Party Pack 2'|E'2015-10-13'|7.8|80|E'Fibbage 2 is a big part of the reason to pick up this party pack.  The original fibbage was limited and was something my friends and I chewed through after ~30 game sessions split into 2/3 nights.  Knowing that there is at least twice the question content makes me feel better about having this second party pack, and the new games have their moments as well.  The biggest oddity to these party packs is, why bother releasing a new game when you can release expansions?  Fibbage is a sure-thing for a party with up to 8 players going at it simultaneously, BS''ing each other.  That''s what makes the game so addicting.  Instead of "hundreds" of questions (the advertising on the website claims ~500 questions in Fibbage 2), Fibbage needs at least double that to really have staying power, and while fact-finding for these questions can consume time, I''m certain there''s more than enough source material to get the question content up to that level.  At that point, questions you''ve seen the answers to will be so far & few between that you may not remember the answer, making for a much longer enjoyment period.  Quiplash XL seems to be the other strong contender here, but the other games that have some appeal don''t quite have the immediate fun-factor.  Instead of tossing in 5 games, offering 2-3 high quality, highly replayable games makes more sense.  I''d gladly shell out $15-$20 a set knowing that I''m getting an incredible deal that will have me hosting house parties just to play these games for months at a time.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/ef5c512d98e2e1a0e62a8cc9ea81e63a-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1329|E'SMITE'|E'2015-08-19'|7.3|80|E'Great game. It really doesn''t have many game modes, or maps for that matter. Which is a drawback. Another downside is the graphics are crisp and clear, but not what you''d think of as a current gen game. Now that we are past the bad points, I should explain why I give it a perfect 10. The game modes it does have, are extremely fun. I was never into MOBA, and still am not into many, but this one feels different. The leveling system is effective, and so is the buying system. There is a counter to just about anything, so nothing, not even the characters, is truly unbeatable. Now EVERY game has this is one way or another. Nothing can always be perfectly even, without there being only one thing. Say CoD, some guns are much stronger than others, so you''re going to use that gun, or something that can compete with it right? The concept stands in Smite. You have the characters that are VERY strong, but aren''t unbeatable. Now, if you plan on playing, let me give you a note of warning. Some characters are beyond annoying. Whether the fact they kill so fast, or are so hard to kill. There is always a drawback. Say the stronger characters, the ones that will 2 shot you, they have so little health, if you can land the hits, you can do the same to them. Another great thing, that interested me in the first place, is the fact it is a free to play game, with OPTIONAL microtransactions. You don''t have to buy the other gods. You can unlock them without paying real cash. And it isn''t as if you have to go on a hardcore grind to ever get them. Play maybe 12 matches of the primary gamemode and tada, you have enough points to get another god if you wish. I rarely encounter server issues. A last point to make here is the community, some people are hostile, this is in every game. But most people are cooperative, and want to work together to win the match. The community for the most part is welcoming of newcomers, and will coach them. The only place you will find people hostile to newcomers is the Ranked league, which by the time you unlock it, you wont exactly be new anymore.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/6e9576d1009cfc7c21ae6698006359eb-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1347|E'Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution'|E'2020-03-24'|0.0|79|E'Yu-Gi-Oh: Legacy of the Duelist Links Evolution - The classic anime card game returns with this installment. Gameplay wise Links Evolution offers up a vast amount of content for players that fans of the series will gobble up happily. Taking part in Online Multiplayer mode and competing in duels that follow tournament rules will offer countless hours of gameplay alone. Coming to the Single Player modes, you are offered up several modes to take part in, Campaign mode firstly where you can relive all the card dueling action from the Iconic 1st series right through to VRAINS. As you battle through you will unlock characters that can be used in the Dueling mode in Single Player, along with Decks and Cards. Using the battle points gained from dueling you can also purchace various things to boost your custom built or premade decks!  Featuring a massive 10,000+ cards there is a huge amount of variety and no deck will ever be truly the same. While some moments of the campaign mode can be very annoying and you are outmatched massively within just a couple of turns (EG: Weevil gets basically gets his Ultimate moth summoned within 1st turn) You can be left feeling utterly hopeless before you can even take a turn and watch on hopelessly as they destroy any monster you summon and drain your lifepoints within a few turns OR you admit defeat and just surrender, HOWEVER believe in the heart of the cards and you will pull through those moments after a few attempts. The visuals are nice, however I honestly felt that it could have done with a boost, feeling slightly dated, however given that this game is pretty much just an updated version of Legacy of the Duelist I suppose a visual update may have been out of the question, and in my opinion the game suffers for it. The controls are very nice and easy to use. Nothing complex here as that is left to the dueling stratagies both employing and countering.  There is a few issues out of the box like the constant prompts each turn if you have a trap / spell card that can be used however these can be skipped by holding the B button or disabled and manual activation of card effects turned on in the settings. Overall: For fans of the Yu-Gi-Oh series I would highly recommend this game to as to relive the action of all the series in a single game. For fans of card games this is a possible good addition for you and does offer a nice story line to follow to boot. As a standalone game it could have used some updates to make it feel and look more current but it doesn''t deter from the game and is still a good solid game.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/d546825903003827d4523f23bb105c4d-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'
1348|E'Flipping Death'|E'2018-08-07'|6.3|79|E'The hint system might be a good idea for some I found it made the game way too easy because instead of giving you an hint it basically tells you what to do. Most of the puzzles in the game fail to pack a punch and I wouldve liked to have seen a little more in terms of variety here. Does Flipping Death do enough to get a recommendation from me. Zoink Games have delivered quite a few memorable experiences and as far as developers go theyre definitely one of my favourites. As you can imagine then I was very excited to get to grips with Flipping Death and thankfully it didnt disappoint. In fact Flipping Death could be the best game that Zoink Games has done so far, which is no small feat considering the amount of successes they have under their belt. Without a doubt this game does more than enough to get a recommendation from me because it has a lot of charm dotted in a number of areas and when the game is in full flow both the story and gameplay are excellent.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/ab7e8ab18b3702893f8272159951a645-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

I have been following this game for a little while and was counting down the days to its release. It does not disappoint. I am a fan of the Tell Tale games and this is slightly similar in play style but they add so many awesome elements to it. I feel this should be more of a standard for future narrative games. With the RPG element and the story can branch in many different directions depending on your choice. The replay value in this game is extremely high. I find myself playing this over and over just to see different conversations and different arks on the story. The story also pulls you in right from the start and with the different types of characters i found myself relating and caring for each in there own way. This is a developer i will be watching to see what great works they release in the future.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/9f8628d1919c11ed0aad4608f003fd8a-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'
1351|E'8-Bit Adventure Anthology: Volume One'|E'2017-10-31'|0.0|79|E'I love when these classic games are brought back to life, and when done correctly they deliver a number of nostalgic moments. Thankfully 8-Bit Adventure Anthology: Volume One has been done correctly and each different game thats been ported plays just like the original so theres buckets of nostalgia present throughout. I forgot how good the stories were in games like this and its a nice pleasant reminder because each story is interesting and keeps you hooked throughout. The puzzles in the game have aged really well and if you love puzzles that offer you a challenge and require some thought then you will love this anthology. I will say though that the cursor in the game can be frustrating when trying to complete the puzzles, and thats mainly down to how slow it moves and in my opinion they could have provided you with an option of speeding the cursor up. They have maintained each game as close to the original as they can and in my opinion this will put some gamers off, and a few slight tweaks here and there would have definitely made the game more accessible to different gamers. I will say though that theyve got the price spot on and it doesnt cost you a lot to take a trip down memory lane, which is great. The presentation side of the game is perfect and Im glad they never changed anything here. Visually the 8-Bit art style has never looked better and the accompanying sound design stirs up a lot of fond memories, which is awesome. At the end of the day from the moment it was first announced I must say that I was looking forward to it, and thankfully it delivered on my expectations I had for the game. Fans of the original games will once again fall in love with them, and the nostalgic feel of the game will put you right back to when you first played the titles on offer. If you dont like old-school games that have had no changes delivered to them then you wont find much enjoyment here, but it gave me a lot of enjoyment and it gets a big recommendation from me.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/25b188c533539c73ded0d9140af9421c-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1354|E'20XX'|E'2018-07-11'|8.0|79|E'A video game that even slightly resembles the Mega Man series has my interest and full attention because its a series that has delivered me so much joy over the years and at the end of the day as far as platformers go its up there with the very best. 20XX has been on the PC for some time now and from the moment I first saw it I was very eager to get to grips with it. Thankfully its finally made its way to the Xbox One and even though it has a few imperfections to say I enjoyed my time with the game would be a massive understatement. Obviously if youre trying to capture the true feel of a game like Mega Man then you have to have very good platforming elements, and thankfully Im pleased to say that theyve got this aspect of the game spot on. By getting this important aspect right it means the gameplay ends up being an incredible amount of fun and thats exactly what 20XX delivers to you. In fact the game was that fun that I quickly forgot about the games high difficulty curve and thats impressive because at times the games difficulty can cause you a few frustrating moments here and there. As I said though I was easily able to look past this and Im glad I did because in terms of content the game has a decent amount for you to be getting on with and the best thing is that the content has a lot of variety thanks to the inclusion of the procedural engine. Despite it having a lot of variety in most areas it wouldve been nice to have seen a little more variety when it came to the enemies you face though because facing the same type of enemies can become a little tedious every now and then. Thankfully though defeating them didnt become tedious and that was mainly down to there being a huge amount of upgrades for you to sink your teeth into and the best thing is that each upgrade actually felt different, which is great. Without a doubt one of my favourite things about this game was its presentation. Visually the game has managed to implement a retro look whilst also having a modern feel to it as well. The sound design also offers you a retro and modern vibe at the same time as well and when both the visuals and sound design combine together the gameplay becomes even more fun. At the end of the day if you like platformers with a Mega Man feel then you will thoroughly enjoy what 20XX has to offer. I really enjoyed my time with the game and if a little bit of a story was included then I probably wouldve enjoyed the game even more. That being said at the end of the day 20XX does more than enough to get a thumbs up from me.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/9a216818b6ef1b4fe8123d21d02ba36b-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1373|E'Wizard of Legend'|E'2018-05-15'|6.8|79|E'No matter how many roguelike games Ive played over the years I still get excited when a new game comes out into the mix and most of the time they provide me with hours upon hours of enjoyment. Thankfully the new release Wizard of Legend provided me with a lot of enjoyment and in some ways it feels unique compared to some of the other games in the genre. One of the main reason why it feels so unique is down to its story. If youre a fan of these particular games youll know that not many of them have much in terms of a story but Wizard of Legend is different. The story thats present in the game is actually pretty decent and the best thing is that it has a lot of interesting lore. Another thing that makes this game unique is that it has an abundance of variety in all areas. The spells you can use in the game are fantastic and are packed full of variety, and by them doing this it means getting in combat with the fantastic enemies never seems to get boring. In fact the gameplay on the whole doesnt end up getting boring but you will have to deal with a very high difficulty curve throughout your time with the game. Despite it being challenging and rewarding at the same time I can see the difficulty being a problem for some. I must admit that the difficulty did cause me a few problems along the way, but it still didnt stop me from returning to the game time and time again. Thankfully though despite the games high difficulty you have very good controls to help you out. The controls in the game remain tight and responsive throughout and this does help you quite considerably. Another thing that wouldve helped with the difficulty curve is knowing what youre buying at the shop. Unfortunately when you come to purchase an item there isnt really an explanation as to what it is or does so you dont know what to really buy, which can be frustrating from time to time. In terms of the presentation side of things I dont expect too much from games like this, but I must admit that I did like Wizard of Legends style. There is a lot of colour in the visuals which is rare in games like this and when you combine those visuals with the very good sound design you end up enjoying the gameplay even more, which is great. At the end of the day Wizard of Legend has everything which I like about this specific genre, and Im not exaggerating when I say its one of my most favourite roguelike adventure games Ive ever played. So without a doubt this game gets a massive recommendation from me and if youre a fan of these types of games then this is a game you cant miss out on.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/37047d1cab7e638990df66fed9fdb66b-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1387|E'Relicta'|E'2020-08-04'|7.3|78|E'Relicta is a first-person puzzle game whose main mechanics combine magnetism and gravity. The player is equipped with a pair of special gloves that allow them to change the magnetic and gravitational properties of experimental cubes scattered around each level. These cubes can be moved by the player, either carrying them bodily or using magnetism or gravity. They can also be placed on teleporting machines to warp them to another teleporter and help solve puzzles. Mechanics really come alive when combined in ingenious ways. For instance, magnetism can be used to repel or attract cubes, but repelling a cube that has previously anti-gravitated gives you a frictionless device that will retain inertia until it collides against something solid, like a wall (or your skull). It can even be used as a means of transport for the player to reach new places. Cubes can also be used to power up some devices, in order to operate doors and force fields. As the player progresses towards more complex puzzles, they will encounter other devices - magnetic plates, elevators, buttons or even drones capable of nullifying magnetic and gravitational fields as well as stealing cubes.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/8197520be475c2635c31b45f6c078089-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1400|E'Bleed 2'|E'2018-02-09'|0.0|78|E'I was a big fan of the first Bleed game even despite its shortcomings, so in a way I was really looking forward to Bleed 2. Thankfully Bleed 2 manages to pretty much improve in all areas over the original game and I must admit that I had a very enjoyable time with the game. The twin-stick gameplay feels better than ever and without a doubt its more addictive than last time. One of the main reasons why the gameplay shines so bright is because the controls feel and react brilliantly. They are easy to grasp and remain tight throughout so any deaths that occur will be your fault only. My favourite thing about the game was definitely the boss battles. Each boss has had a lot of thought and effort put into them and this makes each battle a very memorable and enjoyable affair. In terms of content the game offers you quite a bit, but there isnt much in terms of different levels. I would certainly have loved to have been able to play some more levels because the ones that are present are brilliant. Whilst the game doesnt take long to complete there is plenty of additional content for you to get to grips with and this additional content means that the games replay value is actually pretty high. My biggest disappointment with Bleed 2 came down to its lack of story. There is a little bit of a story present, but in my opinion there is nowhere near enough to satisfy and I was left feeling a little deflated because they couldve done so much more here. I was actually a big fan of the presentation side of the game in the first game so it was really nice to see even more improvements made in this game. Visually the game has a very retro feel to it, which I love. The sound design also has a retro feel to it, but it also possesses modern touches which fit in with the gameplay very well. At the end of the day Bleed 2 has continued the series in great fashion and in my opinion its better than the first game because its took what was good from the first game and added to it, which is great. It still has a couple of niggling problems but you easily forget about these when the game is in full flow. If you were a fan of the first game then you will love everything about Bleed 2 and when everything is said and done it does a fantastic job which results in a massive recommendation from me.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/58e151f556c39973f474acc68178d40a-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

The aim of the game is to conquer, rule and manipulate the Roman Empire with the ultimate goal of being declared as the "Imperator" of Rome. Set in a time when the mighty Roman Empire emerged to conquer the known world against powerful enemies; when gladiators fought to a bloody death in the Coliseum; when Spartacus defied the might of the empire; when Hannibal led his invincible army and his war elephants across the Alps to strike fear into the very heart of Rome itself; and when Julius Caesar finally smashed the Barbarian Gauls. This was a time of brutal confrontation between civilisation and barbarism, and of civil war as the ancient world''s only superpower turned on itself. A completely new Total War engine uses innovative technology and groundbreaking design to bring the world of ancient Rome to life to deliver the biggest and most cinematic battles ever seen in a videogame. So the battles in Rome: Total War maintain the epic scale that fans of Total War are used to, but now use high-detailed 3D polygonal troops and allows huge cities to be displayed on the battlefields.

1515|E'Homeworld: Cataclysm'|E'2000-09-07'|8.8|89|E'The shocking truth that so many people would never really want to consider here, is that Cataclysm is not only a fantastic sequel, but hands down- the best game in the series.  What we can immediately pull away from the amazing presentation is the knowledge that a very intelligent developer named "Barking Dog Studios" saw the potential for the series and worked very hard to make it a better experience all around.  If anyone hasn''t played Homeworld in a while, you''ll remember that it had a fantastically executed story held back just a smidge by occasionally buggy fleet A.I., a killer difficulty curve after the 3rd mission, an almost unfair amount of frustration at times, and of course some cumbersome interface quirks.  This has really all been cleared up by Barking Dog, since not only have they patched and filled some of the irksome frustrations of the interface, but they''ve completely cleaned up the issue with unit balance as well.  Incorporating a unit cap was an incredibly good idea, it adds quite a bit more strategy in when you choose to build your units.  Though this was frowned upon as an overall game-changing mechanic, I thought it made unit preservation that much more important.  And with how much faster paced Cataclysm is compared to its predecessor- it makes a good deal of sense to implement that feature.  Without getting too much into the story, the actual flow of combat is what really drove me to enjoy this game over and over again.  The back and forth of the main factions in game are nothing short of nerve-racking.  Slowly preparing a fleet to do battle with a foe that can reverse your technology and assimilates your ships is terrifying and incredibly interesting.  Working out the balance of your fleet, researching new ways to counter your borg-like foe are all part of the campaign as well as the skirmish modes.  To mention briefly the sound design is nothing short of brilliant, its much more engaging than the original game, though some of the voice work does sound a little goofy initially, overall its very well implemented as well.  The atmospheric soundtrack is back, and though it doesn''t feature anything that standouts as well as the first game, it is still very good.  The games engine itself was starting to see some gray hairs unfortunately, so of course it was polished as well as it could be for 2000.  Between the much more involved story line, the pacing of various space battle, the more efficient research and harvesting system- the game easily outdoes 1999''s origin tale.  If not by design alone, it certainly features a much more engaging plot that really goes all out in conveying the urgency of stopping your mistake that was born from foolish ignorance.  If you have always wondered what the best "sequel" was, this is it, this is the actual "Homeworld 2" and their is really nothing like it inside the real time strategy genre.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/ea96590b4f81b762621fbb8606462310-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder. You don''t have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don''t have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you''ve previously unlocked. You''ll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn''t allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you''ll never meet new players only to discover that you can''t play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.

We have added twelve new aircraft that were designed with the help of over thirty real warbird pilots. You will also experience revolutionary, explosive, special effects like never before. Witness towering explosive blasts, aircraft being torn in half, and smoke drifting thousands of feet above the battlefields. Using authentic military test data and combat footage was the design team''s primary focus. Under the hood, you will find every aircraft, building, and vehicle reacting precisely as they did when you unleash all of the newly designed weapons. Specific targets will require specific weapons, just like the real thing. You will also get to fly the famous B-17 Flying Fortress, man all of the gunner positions, and even attack those bomber formations from the cockpit of some of Germany''s most ingenious, flying machines. Shrapnel will fly, tanks will blow, and guns will shred their targets to pieces. In fact FirePower is so real, you may find all you ever do is attack anything that has the misfortune of crossing your sights.

1616|E'Europa Universalis IV'|E'2013-08-13'|8.7|87|E'WOW! For about ten years Paradox Development have been a small team of nice guys working hard to give us good games and mostly failing. Their games have been for the most part tedious, pretentious and ugly, with cluttered mechanisms, and hideous micromanagement. Most of the Paradox efforts suffered from terrible tutorials and ridiculous learning curved that discouraged any vaguely casual gamers. But beyond inaccessibility, the games were finally not that good, because even when you figured out the mechanisms they were still too MECHANICAL: not even really worth learning in the end because they were all variations of a sausage machine. However something miraculous happened with Crusaders Kings 2, and echoes of the good things we saw in earlier games (Hearts of Iron 2) reappeared: Better looking graphics. Simpler, yet DEEPER gameplay.  The machine kept churning away but Paradox learned to save us from the worst of it, and the gameplay began to blossom. Europa Universalis IV seems to demonstrate that Paradox has really turned the corner. The game is beautiful.  Gameplay is fluid. The depth and complication is welcome, but it has been softened with a more thoughtful and gaming friendly structure! GREAT WORK PARADOX! Good things take time, and your grand ambitions are finally bearing fruit. I''m very excited about where this will lead with the Hearts of Iron series, because all the design wisdom that we can see in CK2 and EU4 is leading in the absolute correct direction. If you love strategy gaming please go and buy this game and support this developer! This is a FAR, FAR superior game to Civilizations 1-5 as well as anything put out by Creative Assembly. It''s been a long wait but worth it. Can''t wait to see what we get when the final few pieces of the game design puzzle fall into place. If they get the budget to build something with a more solid multiplayer experience we will see the PERFECT game.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/85323ac84f46e24f9f6ad565c63bcb54-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

1645|E'Total Annihilation'|E'1997-09-27'|8.8|86|E'Long ago, the galaxy had known peace. Paradise was ruled with the hand of science, and the hand was that of the galactic governing body known as the Core. Ironically, it was the Core''s ultimate victory, the victory over death itself, that brought about the downfall of its paradise and started the war that would decimate a million worlds. The immortality process, known as "patterning," involved the electronic duplication of brain matrices, allowing the transfer of consciousness into durable machines. Effectively it meant immortality, and the Core decreed the process mandatory for all citizens in order to ensure their safety. However, there were many citizens unwilling to toss aside their bodies so casually, many indeed who regarded patterning as an atrocity. They fled to the outer edges of the galaxy, forming a resistance movement that became known as the Arm. War began, though it was never officially declared by either side. The Arm developed high-powered combat suits for its armies, while the Core transferred the minds of its soldiers directly into similarly deadly machines. The Core duplicated its finest warriors thousands of times over. The Arm countered with a massive cloning program. The war raged on for more than 4,000 years, consuming the resources of an entire galaxy and leaving it a scorched wasteland.

I like how you can change your playstyle such as walking slower but jumping higher in exchange for apples. Apples are the games main collectibles which allow you to purchase different forms of slime san allowing different playstyles as mentioned above, hats and a few other accessories, borders of detailed art and shaders that can make the game look like it is an old vhs tape or like you''re playing it on a gameboy. There is also coins to collect by finding secret exits and new, funny characters that are often references to other games or movies and you can guide them back to slumptown, the place where all previously mentioned items can be purchased. You can use these coins to purchase minigames which act as fun little distractions from the main game. Nothing to write home about but fun nonetheless. You purchase these minigames in an arcade where you can meet a hedghog who''s known for his speed called cinos and a speedrunner. There is also a set of challenges which task you with destroying all of the targets in a pre built stage in a set time. The reward for success is an apple. This takes place in a dojo where you also meet red shadow who is your biggest fan and is mentioned throughout slumptown.The morphing ability that slows down time is innovative and fun and opens up all sorts of new opportunities in level design which the developers had no trouble siezing.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/229927d0a28eeb86e321370a0aefeedd-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

In this game they went all out with the soundtrack and there''s tons of great battle themes, amazing boss themes and the soundtrack is a strong one where almost every song is memorable. This is a must play game. Some may ask about the time limit. Yes Ayesha has one. However, it is incredibly forgiving and it''s almost impossible to fail the time limit in this game. So do not worry if you are a beginner. Ayesha is a excellent game for new Atelier players to start with.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/9270b7cee7b64254a926ccffcf2cae6f-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

I would highly recommend this game for people that enjoy Binding of Isaac or enter the gungeon but in this game you are not encouraged to kill every Zombie.  You are reminded to avoid and run to conserve bullets when you can.  I paid 8.99 and i bought it twice (ps4,Switch) I have no regrets.  It''s a fun addicting game.  the greatest thing about this game is the custom characters,  you can add everyone you know and they join the adventure.  The only things I would change is the over all look is done in that 8 bit style which i am sick of.  it would look better in 16 bit.  8 bit sucks... but maybe it''s because I am older and remember playing 8 bit when it was all that I had.  I also think there should be more weapons,  more of everything.  If you''re gonna do random, make a ton of weapons and items.  But anyways, what do i know.

2157|E'Metal Slug Anthology'|E'2007-03-28'|8.6|80|E'This game collection is awesome! Excellent collection for excellent price! I bought it last tuesday on ebay and receive yesterday. The gameplay is arcade perfect and sound and graphic too! Loading times are short and small slowdown of framerate is only in Metal Slug 2 (like MVS cabinet version). All other 6 games (Metal Slug 1 X 3 4 5 6) have smooth framerate. Everything other seems to be fine, but is not. I found difference between manual and game. For example: in manual is that there is display option, that you can set Original pixel, Full screen and 4:3. But in game option there is no display option! And in manual is that if I choose EASY, it give me 30 credits, if I choose NORMAL, it give me 20 credits and if I give HARD, it give me 10 credits. But in game option, there I can choose between EASY MEDIUM and HARD, but it no changes number of credits. I can set 20 10 or 5 credits. That is different. And in maual is that: "Continues - Choose between Unlimited or Limited continuse. Okay...so you think you have got the "right stuff"? Choose "Limited" and see if you can beat the game with a set number of lives. Special bonus items await to the true METAL SLUG champion." In game i cant set to the limited, because there is only FREE PLAY, 5, 10, 20. and there are more differences between manual and game. For example, on page 8, there isi some Token system and Wallpapers in Gallery but in game there arent. And in manual is, that if I give PAUSE MENU, there I can save my current game. But in game this function isnt. I think this PS2 manual of Metal Slug Anthology is only slighty updated PSP manual. Because, in this PS2 manual do not fits pictures. On page 8, there is something with Game Lobby and Connect. And the buttons are Playstations. Surely the pictures are from PSP version. And I read review for PSP version of MSA, that in PSP version you can choose between Original resolution, 4:3 and 16:9. I think that is enought to say, that the MANUAL have a LOT OF DIFFERENCES. BUT THAT DO NOT AFFECT ON GAMES. THEY ALL ARE GREAT!'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/3f14bfc333e9c212c4426e6208e7b8a2-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

The engine sounds are not great, however this game is not at all about your vehicles engine sounds and don''t take from the game one bit. The sirens on the police vehicles are constantly going which can wear on the ears.....but it''s necessary because they are cops, and all cops have sirens.  Anyway even though the graphics are not as detailed as later generation titles on PS2 it does not take away from the fun you have running across massive and very deep landscapes.  It''s a blast running from the police climbing extremely steep hills and plunging back down.  Avoiding cops is fun, but trying to screw over your smuggling competition by stealing the contraband from them while you''re both trying to avoid the cops is even more fun.  It is truly a unique concept for a racing game.

Along the way, players will be able to assemble their ideal X-Men crew from over 15 of the most popular characters from the last 40 years, including Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Gambit and Beast, to name a few. However, before players load-up their squad with heavy hitters, they will have to take their foes'' abilities into consideration as certain situations may benefit from the abilities of specific X-Men. While Cyclops'' optic blasts and Colossus'' immense strength are great for clearing a path through hordes of enemies, players can opt to bring Wolverine and Nightcrawler along on a stealth intensive mission to help circumvent detection devices. Once the action begins, players can take control of any member of their squad and even execute multi-character combinations such as the famous Wolverine/Colossus Fastball Special.

Small visual elements will also be altered slightly, adding to the oppressing atmosphere where nothing is what it seems.

2384|E'Tekken Tag Tournament'|E'2000-10-25'|8.4|85|E'This is definatly a step up to the arcade version and quite possible my faviroute Tekken game in the series so far. Tekken Tag Tournament is the first instalment of the "Tag" series and brings back previous characters from the earlier Tekken games. The graphics have certainly boosted up a notch from the PS1 and Arcade versions, some of the stages are fantastic - pyramid temples, colosseum''s and dojos. Gameplay is still the same as before, but there are some new fighting moves, different game modes to play and for the first time you can play as not one, but two characters in each fight. Not all characters are available to start off with, you have to unlock them in Arcade mode. Fight your way through 8 different stages by kicking, punching and wrestling each opponent and you will unlock a new character as well as a nice short theatre clip from each character you complete Arcade in. If you''ve played Tekken before, then most of the moves you''ll know already but if you''re new to the series, you may want to get some practicing done in Practice mode. You can change the difficulty settings if want to challenge yourself and become a master at the game. Of course this game wouldn''t be Tekken without (my personal faviroute) multiplayer, where you and your friend can choose two different characters (4 altogether). Another new feature to this game is if you have a Multitap, you can have up to 4 players to make it even more enjoyable. You and your friends can get loads of aggressive fun, competing against one another to become the champion. If that wasn''t enough for you why not play a much relaxing game of bowling, yes you heard me right bowling, something you might wanna try if you have a bad headache after all that anger and shouting from multiplayer. One thing that disappoints me is even though you can use two characters tag in each fight, the round ends after one of them is defeated rather than finish them both off. This would have been a nice option to let you configure this. Usually I would get bored of the same old repetitive fighting but it still manages to charm for the fourth time running.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/181cf4bdbdd85e4783f82525a766e4e5-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

On paper, it sounds unique but it falls just short in the fact that there is no real incentive to stay in the Hero bar unless you just want the in-game Task Forces off your back. It would have been far more innovative to create multiple endings and tie it in with this system, say getting a bad ending if you''re too far into the Menace bar.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/7966265b5e59540eb234ceca911dc2ab-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

2763|E'Blood Wake'|E'2001-12-25'|7.6|71|E'There is just something about this game that brings back memories of when the XBOX first came out and all the games had great graphics, not just a simple lackluster Playstation 2 port with last generation graphics that seems to be the norm now. I still play this game to this date, feeling like it is still brand new. The graphics killed every other game at the launch,even most out recently, yes including Halo, which I''m tired of hearing it still has the best graphics on the Box. No other game that I''ve played on the Box says XBOX like this one, at least to me. There has been only one other game like this before, being Cobra Triagle on the NES. There probably won''t be another like it because of bad reviews when everyone was so caught up in Halo that everything else was overlooked or frowned upon. Also this game has millions of polygons running at 30 frames per second during the entire game which makes it difficult for a developer to make again since the first one was so overlooked and they won''t spend all that time making another one(shame on you XBOX audience). I was hoping for a sequel but the so called professional reviewers screwed that up for everybody. I will only buy or play Xbox exclusives from now on because every time one of us buys a game that is also on the Playstation 2, we are not only having to settle for barely upgraded PS1 graphics, we are telling developers we will settle for barely passable games. Maybe I have forgotten what gaming is all about, but I haven''t forgotten why I bought an XBOX in the first place. The most powerful hardware in a console bar-none, capable of blowing Gamecube and Gaystation 2 away. What every happened to the whole reason the XBOX was made for anyway? The graphics engine in the Box has been overlooked for far too long. It is time to awaken the monster and "freakin'' use" the damn hardware. I might as well start backing Sony and flushing my money down the toilet if my XBOX games aren''t going to look any better than Sony''s garbage!'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/7cbc5c10d0ccba49daa968e5e26b2784-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

2776|E'Batman: Vengeance'|E'2001-12-18'|5.4|70|E'With ubisoft''s crappy reception with previous batman games, they finally got it right and made you feel like the dark knight. First person mode didn''t really bother me but hey at least it was better than dark tomorrows weapons controls. Batman''s combat was very well done and the super moves was a blast to use and they were very good and quick to use compared to begins where begins combat system where slow and dull. Vehicles stages where awesome and the music was beautiful, which made me feel like i was in a episode of batman the animated series and environment captures the show.  Guys i know that this is old but at least ubisoft tried and gave us a good batman game where it made you feel like the dark knight and you gotta admit that the arkham games borrowed some elements  from vengeance and rise of sin tzu so without these games their would be no arkham and many people and review s such as kwing, ign and gamestop like this game. Also, i loved the stealth and quick stealth in this game. What is quick stealth? Well if people read the manual it is activated when you use a smoke bomb on a enemy and go behind the and press the y button to do a stealth take down, which is awesome and finish the combat fight smoothly in case you don''t wanna fight or  you are lossing health.  Finding ammo is easy cause you just have to look around. Instead of bashing this game, i would like to thank ubisoft for redeeming themselves and worked hard in making this game because they would have just given us a half assed batman game like batman beyond return of the joker. Story was alright except for the first act but it was a good kind of alright cause it reminded me alot of the animated series and i loved the swat chase level cause it was a sort of homage to the batman mask of phantasm scene where batman was chased by the cops, which was my favorite scene and i love  playing that level. If you are a die hard batman fan, then buy this game, but if you are just  a gamer who may like batman then give this a shot. It is a classic batman game that started it all.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/78ed3668987c8f3bf315cdfd057fbb68-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Additionally, players can play Quick Shot Mode to see if they have the fastest trigger fingers around! Once gamers have their scores, they can go to the online leaderboards to see how they compare with other players in their region and can keep playing to improve their ranking. There''s also significant depth and replay value to this challenging game, as players can keep practicing to learn all of the different strategies to achieve bonus points in both 2-Minute and 5-Minute Modes. If they discover them all, players might have a shot at having the top score in the world. Like traditional vertically-scrolling shooters, the game features a top-down perspective and players fly from the bottom of the screen towards the top, shooting at any ship or structure that obstructs their path. As players progress, they can collect power-ups to increase their weapon or shield strength, and an all-new Force System enables gamers to collect up to five orbiting satellites that can be held close to the ship for defensive cover, or can be sent out for additional firepower. Players can also decide how they want to play, choosing from three control schemes  Nunchuk and Wii Remote, Wii Remote only (held sideways) or the Classic Controller.

The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in Phantom Hourglass. Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he''s accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touch screen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm. When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks. Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system. As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.

But I sold my Nintendo Wii and I traded this game in as well and never looked back. I had bought a Wii U but it sat in storage for almost 5 years in Calgary because I was hoping to move back there someday thinking the oil and gas bust was temporary but it never did improve out there.the days of money growing on trees was done out there. After the storage company kept raising prices on me thinking Im never going to return and it was free money for them. I finally went and got all my stuff...as soon as I hooked up my Wii U..I remembered that you could play Wii games and thought Id pick up a few at the pawn shop. I was browsing their 1$ selection(yes..thats right 1$ selection) and what do you know..there it was..wayne Gretzkys nhl slapshot. Even though some sports games like NHL number titles are just updated rosters with very little gameplay difference..some titles feel like experimental titles and this was the case for this game. I find its more arcade and fast paced And not bogged down by simulation like other titles. A game has to be fun. This game is incredibly fun because its pick up and play and the gameplay and graphics still are great to this day. Sure I own all the latest nhl titles and threes and ones are a blast to play with friends. But when it comes to beer or whatever..games like nhl hitz 2003, nhl arcade, and nhl slapshot..these games get more playtime just because they are fun and competitive. Ill be honest..realistic games arent fun to me. I recently downloaded dirt 2.0 and my god,..what a nightmare.,sure if your a simulation freak then go right ahead..I found it boring and no fun..I dont like where it takes weeks or months just to understand the depth of a game..sure I dont want to shallow either but like I was saying...if you want a great arcade sports title to fit in your Wii library..pick this one up..I think youll enjoy it.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/621e8be403782a5879eee477a0c439be-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

There were a few minor problems with motion controls and the camera was a bit crazy at times. The detriment of some sloppy controls was nearly balanced by the nerd joy of waving your hand to shoot webbing. 7/10   EXTRAS- It was ambitious to have, essentially, four games in one and worked very well but the game felt too short. The voice acting was top notch, though a bit repetitive (I''m looking at you Ultimate Spider-Man). 8/10   For normal, well adjusted, members of society this game is worth renting just to experience the different styles (especially Noir) and it is a comic geek must own title. This game was very nearly a masterpiece of comic book hero greatness but needed less repetition and a bit more polish. 8/10.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/4/6923e312fee2bef29c9e077a9330ba6a-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

The expansive story, created under direction from George Lucas, is set during the largely unexplored era between "Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith" and "Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope." In it, players assist the iconic villain in his quest to rid the universe of Jedi - and face decisions that could change the course of their destiny. Unleash and upgrade the Secret Apprentice''s four core Force powers - Force push, grip, repulse and lightning - throughout the course of the game, and combine them for ultra-destructive, never-before-seen combos. The Secret Apprentice doesn''t just Force push enemies into walls - he Force pushes enemies through walls. The Secret Apprentice doesn''t just Force grip foes to throw them aside - he Force grips them in midair, zapping them with lightning, then dropping them to the ground to explode like a bomb. In addition to new adversaries created just for the game, such as fugitive Jedi and Force-sensitive Felucians, players also confront and associate with familiar faces from the Star Wars films, including Darth Vader. Visit locations such as Episode III''s Wookiee homeworld Kashyyyk and the floral Felucia, the junk planet Raxus Prime, plus an Imperial TIE fighter construction facility. Decisions made by players throughout the game determine the path of the story, including multiple endings that will rock Star Wars continuity as they know it.

Comprised of only three distinct parts (colored sides, tentacles and life force), the focus of your rotozoan life is simple: grow your tentacles. After playing a few levels and learning the basics of your microscopic world, you begin to unlock additional modes of play and the ability to choose the number of tentacles on your rotozoan. Each mode has its own specific purpose: reach a particular length with your tentacles or grow them to the greatest length possible. In either mode, growing your tentacles means absorbing enemies known as goobugs by touching them. There''s just one catch: Successfully absorbing a goobug depends on matching its color to your tentacle. Also, longer tentacles can more easily come in contact with incorrectly colored goobugs (causing damage to the tentacle and decreasing your life force), and the goobugs themselves multiply and begin adapting to your movement. Luckily, objects such as the restorative heart item and special attack-enabling cyclone item can be found floating in the ooze to help your rotozoan survive. With atmospheres ranging from peaceful to intensely challenging, Art Style: Rotozoa offers a wide variety of levels. Victory can only be achieved through quick, precise movement and the ability to remain calm under pressure. Are you ready to take on the goobugs?

Anyone can pick up the Wii Zapper and become a master marksman in the quick-play shooting galleries of Link''s Crossbow Training. Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score. Link''s Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. The Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link''s crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this). Link''s Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage''s goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.

3517|E'Puchi Puchi Virus'|E'2009-05-20'|0.0|73|E'Puchi Puchi Virus does not resemble the ordinary puzzle game. The usual "object drop" style was replaced with a more intuitive system of "object linkage". Its simple design and surprisingly in-depth game play can addict even the most demanding puzzle game enthusiasts. The object is to form at least a single triangle formation by linking viruses together and erasing them from the screen. Victory conditions vary from mission to mission, but erasing all of the viruses will be the fundamental rule of this game. Erase all the viruses and you win, but if the screen gets filled with the emerging viruses you lose. Note: there is a twist to this system that gives depth to the game play. Viruses turn to stone if left alone for a while, which cannot be selected to form a triangle. However, these stones can be erased if they are within a triangle that you create. With a little luck and practice players can rake in massive points by letting the viruses turn to stones and erasing them all at once.

Xevious consists of a spaceship shoot em'' up game where you skilfully dodge projectiles, shoot down enemy crafts and bomb grounded enemy vehicles, buildings and turrets. The main purpose of the game is to survive as long as possible and to score as high as possible in the points category. The game is not easy however, one shot to your craft is enough to take it down and lose a life and you are usually bombarded with a large amount of enemy fire. A high score table and control editing is available in the improved menu interface. There is also an interrupt save feature so you can quit in the middle of a game and return to it in the exact location you left off. The 3D effect gives the game a sense of depth and makes it far easier to judge differences from threats in the air and on the ground. If you are a fan of classic spaceship shoot em'' ups and/or difficult games, take a look.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/3/7d4de9a9eee8ec61656bb01451ef90d7-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

There''s plenty of levels and the in-level challenges we see in many LEGO games aren''t lacking in number. The only issues I see, though, is the voice actors aren''t the same as the movie actors, the voices sounding like bad impressions throughout (with some exceptions, but it''s to the ears of the beholder) and the cut-scenes are blurry. There isn''t a straight-up tutorial, but with over 150 characters each with different abilities and weapons i can see why but there isn''t a pop-up screen to show you controls. You figure it out as you go (I still can''t figure out how to block...).

If you are firing, you are invulnerable. This might be expected to make the game easy, but you can only fire for a limited time after uncovering enemies with your sonar. This adds some tension -- you frantically uncover enemies, then blast away, trying to get them all. If you don''t, then you might have to dodge for a second or two. But the game is not mainly about dodging -- it''s about firing and uncovering enemies. Once this is understood, it becomes a very tense, richly challenging and engrossing game. But not a particularly impossible one -- just strange and unusual. And very appreciated for the 3DS.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/479175d30492b60610f092f2aed9d2b4-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

When I bought this game last December, I was a bit hesitant since believe it or not it was the most expensive 3ds game at that moment in my local video game store. Probably it''s because of the poor demand for the game, well upon playing it for the first time, I was really satisfied with the gameplay even though it''s a simple brain game with additional 3d enhancements. The game is intended to be a 90 day course, meaning you''ll have to play it daily but you can actually play a few games all at once but I warn you as the game progresses the difficulty of the puzzles also increases. However, the main drawback of this game is that it tends to be boring in the long run and a bit frustrating because there are instances where in even the warm-up exercises are too difficult that you''ll need to cheat by searching for the answers online or through books (well maybe it''s just me). Also, I hate the fact that the some of the math puzzles tend to be too easy especially the one regarding with divisibility because once you have learned the divisibility rules, you''ll easily ace those puzzles. The game is still a good addition to your 3ds game library and it will surely help you work-out out that rusting brain.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/ebeee90d27c14fcc5fef6e382eaea042-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

3710|E'The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D'|E'2011-06-19'|9.0|94|E'As the original Ocarina of Time was my favorite game ever, this title had the advantage of triggering rose tinted memory''s of the original, but the severe disadvantage of having to live up to them. This it did with flying colours. While you wouldn''t notice at first glance, every texture and object model has been upgraded, so the general effect is to make the game look as good as you remember it (rather than as blocky as it actually was). Some of the sounds seem to have been re-recorded, but so faithfully to the original so that you might never notice. The music is as beautiful and epic as ever, though you will need headphones to truly appreciate the upgrade.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/4b6d1d1a1f09f9feb540f1337278a155-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

3712|E'The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds'|E'2013-11-22'|9.0|91|E'What initially looked like a game leaning on the aging crutches of A Link to the Past has turned out to be a thoroughly poignant, vivid and immensely satisfying game worthy of standing on its own two feet. Set in the world of A Link to the Past, Link Between Worlds makes the serendipitous combination of a reinvigorating spark with a meaty hit of nostalgia. Presenting freedom of choice gameplay not seen since the original, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds makes no effort to hold the players hand through the richly dense world of Hyrule  and it works brilliantly. Rather than following in the footsteps of Game Freak and introducing the franchise to a new generation of audiences at the risk of patronising its long term fans, (Im looking at you Pokmon X and Y) Link Between Worlds pays homage to those of us who have followed Link since his debut over 25 years ago  all whilst paving the way for a reinvention of what it means to make a Zelda game. The puzzles in Link Between Worlds are, as aforementioned, immensely satisfying. I could almost hear the pieces of a riddle snap together in my head as I strived to calculate the answer. Its a feeling experienced whilst playing the Professor Layton series, but puzzle-solving in this game is made relevant and interesting by the vivid world, close to perfect combat and awe-inspiring imagination. This is a beautiful game, presenting a colourful and vibrant world that just seems to radiate adventure and exploration. The characters are complex and interesting, but perhaps the biggest achievement in terms of its presentation is the silky-smooth 60fps frame rate which stays consistent throughout this 18 hour adventure  even with the 3D effect turned on.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/5/65736a8ac310d01c49484d0c71b8cfb2-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

3717|E'Zero Escape: Virtue''s Last Reward'|E'2012-10-23'|8.7|88|E'I don''t think I could love this game more if I tried. This game is the visual novel/puzzle sequel to the DS game ''999: 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors'', and after loving the first game, this one completely surpassed my expectations. This one included increasing text speed and also being able to go to different points in the game, which were very frustrating in the original. This means you won''t have to play a room twice if you don''t want. It''s heavily text based, but there are lots of good puzzles and escape the room type scenarios to enjoy. As far as the storyline goes, it''s confusing at times, requires some thinking, but it''s completely captivating. I enjoyed all the characters, and it managed to be funny and touching. There''s only one save slot, but I can understand why, so it wasn''t an issue for me at all. There''s also a noted bug in the 3DS version where if you save in certain rooms the game becomes corrupted, this did not happen to me, as I followed advice to not save while in an active puzzle room. I totaled about 45 hours with the game and all paths completed. This is THE 3DS game for me.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/2/fa17136502d0fdfdcd0563ccf0778d1a-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

3762|E'Pokemon Alpha Sapphire'|E'2014-11-21'|7.4|82|E'Just finished this game, and I have to say this is hands down one of the best Pokmon games I''ve ever played, let alone of the greatest Nintendo games of recent years! This game pays so much homage to the beloved Ruby/Sapphire titles for the Gameboy Advance whilst keeping the game relevant for newer players with a sizeable amount of new mega evolutions, all of which are amazing fun to use. The introduction of Primal Evolution is an interesting mechanic and is executed well within the story, I just wish it had been expanded upon a bit more. Music wise, I have to say this game sticks faithful to the original games'' roots while extending the themes with orchestral remixes that perfectly fit the tone. Overworld wise, not a huge deal has changed, except the world looks so much more alive in 3D, with the newly bustling Mauville being a particular highlight of the adventure, and the new Gym Puzzles being incredibly satisfying. While the game may seem easy to fans of the original game due to the Exp. Share buff to spread to all party members, this may be switched off and on at will, allowing fans of the original games to experience the same difficulty. For those who are worried about there being "too much water", I can reassure you that surfing speed is vastly increased in OR/AS and water routes feel smaller, so you don''t feel as swamped by water as you did in Ruby and Sapphire. New mechanic wise, sneaking up on a Pokmon is a small, but welcome addition that allows access to rare Pokmon with increased stats and rare moves, and allows you to discover new Pokmon in previously explored areas. Lastly, the "Delta Episode" in the aftergame links perfectly with Pokmon X and Y, tying up loose ends, and ending a few hours worth of extra gameplay for old and new fans alike to enjoy, culminating in two incredible legendary captures at the end, and the announcement that all the other non-event legends are now catchable, vastly increasing replayability. Add to that the return of the PSS, Pokmon Amie, and Super Training, and you have a well-rounded package that is the perfect difficulty for newcomers, whilst holding enough depth to keep dedicated Pokmon fans hooked for months. Simply put this game is near flawless. (My only problem with this game I could find was it seemed to easy, but with Ruby and Sapphire being my favourite games, I cannot make a value judgement  as to whether this is due to experience with the original titles or not).'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/0d61b89ebaf8a59f486f16d1a98ece80-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Nevertheless, the game was fantastic and I really loved every single aspect of it. I did played the previous game, Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, but it didn''t have quite the appeal at all. Persona Q2 has a better story, which you can relate to in some aspect of your life. The dialogues and interactions between the characters are lively and funny, they don''t fell like they have been forced at all. The idea of the dungeons is very well built and creative. The dungeon navigation is more entertaining and less of a hassle. The boss battles are unique and hard just enough to enjoy them. Overall, if you did play PQ and liked it or didn''t like it at all, I highly recommend playing PQ2, since it''s an enhanced version of it.

It was the beginning of a new era- the Cold War. October 16, 1962. The President of the United States received word that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The world trembled in fear as the prospect of nuclear war loomed ever closer. After days of tense negotiations, the Soviets finally agreed on the 28th to withdraw their missiles from Cuban soil. With the resolution of this incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence. However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had defected to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S. government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his native land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it will mark the beginning of a new age of fear. August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit to Sokolovs research facility, located to the south of the great Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero, FOX is a next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX units modus operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar, into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.

3815|E'Etrian Mystery Dungeon'|E'2015-04-07'|7.9|77|E'Far off in the mountains, the small village Aslarga becomes a hub for adventurers looking for fame and fortune from the Mystery Dungeons. But dire challenges await even the most stalwart adventurers in Etrian Mystery Dungeon, a turn-based action RPG rogue like developed by ATLUS and Spike Chunsoft. The Nintendo 3DS exclusive mixes Etrian Odyssey''s vast RPG party and skill customization aspects, and Mystery Dungeon''s infinitely random dungeon adventures. There''s no hand-holding in Etrian Mystery Dungeon. The action/turn based combat means that battling monsters is not just about using the right skills, but becomes an elegant Pas de Quatre of strategic positioning. Players form their parties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, such as Landsknecht and Runemaster, customize individuals using Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into the dungeons. Always randomized with various levels and paths, the dungeons require plenty of exploration, not to mention the incredible loot rewards -- just be wary of what waits among the deepest depths.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/1/f7debdfa56b5a425ae8e622444f3ddb4-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

Desperately trying to escape and survive, players will experience unnatural, unnerving and decidedly uncensored horrors through the eyes  and ears -- of these frightened teenaged victims. Detailed 2D sprite animations and art stills show the bloody and unsettling fates that await those who enter, and full Japanese-language voice-acting combines with 3D audio support to create a simulated surround sound experience when playing with headphones, offering players a delightfully uncomfortable level of immersion.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/dd3eda9e490dc1ed57eb83e8c69a0a3a-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

When activating a save point, using a special skill or clearing a mission, Kudos are converted into bonus points. The Muse''s song: For as long as you can maintain 1000 or more Kudos, the BGM will change and Lumen AKA The Muse (or in Copen''s story, Lola) will sing for you. Anthem: When Gunvolt or Copen''s HP reaches 0, the Muse''s power can bring them back to life, with additional power-ups. In that state, the BGM will change to the Muse''s song.

3835|E'Crimson Shroud'|E'2012-12-13'|8.0|76|E'I am just going to come out and say this; Crimson Shroud is my game of the year.  Now, I admit, my tastes probably fall pretty far out of the mainstream, but I genuinely enjoyed this game immensely.  Combat is old school turn based RPG fare, but this is the best implementation of that style that I have played since Final Fantasy X.  After Final Fantasy XIII, I felt that the idea of an RPG without mazes could never work, but Crimson Shroud totally pulls it off.  You don''t direct a character around in a typical fashion; instead, you select any room in the dungeon, and your characters go directly there without random battles, it doesn''t matter if it is the room next door or three floors away.  Now, in order to proceed to the next level, you will have to find the room with the trigger, but that is part of the fun.  Several things about the production really grabbed me.  The US translation is top notch.  There is a lot of text in this game.  Every room and item has a detailed description and they are written in a way that really pulled me into the fantasy atmosphere.  I also fell in love with the soundtrack, which definitely has a deep Final Fantasy Tactics lineage.  I have read other reviewers mention short play throughs of Crimson Shroud, but it took me 12 hours to complete my first time, which is a perfect length for a busy guy like me.  Save anywhere also fits well with my lifestyle.  This is the game I have been silently begging for for ages.  This game feels like an evolution of the original NES Final Fantasy, if they had decided to forget about flashy cinematics and focus on telling a story through limited visuals with solid writing.  If the idea of a turn based RPG by the Final Fantasy Tactics team sounds at all interesting to you, I highly recommend you download Crimson Shroud.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/7/51fa26fbbd66e364afedfb65e4ddc41a-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

You can now play for a league championship and you can also take on the role of a footballer and make your way up the professional ranks.The graphics in both PES games are definetly a cut above FIFA 11. It''s biggest draw back is still the lack of licensing of teams though. PES 12 has all of the top tiers for the Italian, Dutch, French, and Spanish Leagues to name a few; no authentic English Premier league or German league. It also has a few individual teams such as Man U. But if you want to play for the Barclays Premiership, you might have to compete against the likes of North London and West Midlands Village. If that doesn''t bother you, then this game is a good time waster.

3894|E'Nintendogs + Cats: Toy Poodle & New Friends'|E'2011-03-27'|7.1|71|E'The new Nintendogs introduces cats, which add more of a diversity among your pets and are also fun to play with. But there are only 3 types of cats compared to the 27 species of dogs that are available, so the game still mainly focuses on training your pooches. In addition to this, cats cannot go on walks or compete in contests, so they are stay at home pets. The walks in this game are terrible, and are completely butchered versions from the first nintendog games. You cannot travel all across town and can only travel about a quarter of the max amount of walking in the first games, but there is the ability to go to different places in town such as cafes. There is your street, the beachside, the main part of town, and the nearby mountains to walk in. The gifts received during walks mostly consist of garbage that can be recycled for other gifts, you cant pick up hats or collors anymore either. It is also much harder to earn money because contests early on only give you about $10 for coming in 1st place, and they also progressively get harder to win because sand pits come in during the 3rd cup for disc competitons. Another letdown is that the # of pets you can have has decreased from 8 to 6, meaning less fun and diversity among pets. In conclusion, i give the game a 7.5, but a 8 is the closest to it, so I''ll deal with it, for now...'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/f3befaf3c1220626d889395628c1df71-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

The challenge is there and the fun factor is way up.    the graphics are nice and the music really puts you in the mood to play.   You get to use a rocketbelt, plane, and a hang glider.   the hang glider for me was the most fun of the three but the rocketbelt is up there.   you fly over an island chain which has many visuals that the wii sports resort didn''t.    This is one of the best pilotwings ever made.    I especially liked Pilotwings 64 and hope they release it on the VC.    this game has more achievements it seems than other pilotwings.    there are also surprise things about this game where you get to use different vehicles and flying abilities.  But i won''t tell you what.    So far I''ve played this game over 7 hours and still am unable to finish it.   I''m not sure why people are saying its easy cause to me it isn''t.   But modern games are more difficult for me than they were as a young kid growing up playing Super Nintendo.    If you''ve enjoyed any of the other Pilotwings or Wii Sports Resort this game comes highly recommended.'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/e5bb19286dccbf78d644bca881380476-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'

The player advances and collects money by defeating enemies and must explore to discover items used to increase abilities, such as magic and transformation. Several years ago, a strange man made his way to the ruins of an abandoned castle on the outskirts of a small town called Verulia. Since then, the townspeople''s fear of the castle has grown, and none would dare venture near it. Recently, a merchant traveled to Verulia and discovered the entire town was deserted. Her story was embellished, as disturbing rumors of a vampire inhabiting the castle spread like wildfire through the land. As Latis has become older and learned more about herself from Cereza, she feels she is destined by her heritage, to bring an end to any threat that vampires pose to humanity. After a lengthy discussion with Emarle, who raised Latis since she was a baby and whom Latis considers to be her mother, its agreed that she must go with Cereza and travel to Verulia. Latis, travels to the town of Verulia to infiltrate the ancient castle in order to defeat the vampire lord residing there. During her exploration she will obtain powerful items greatly improving her abilities.

She will learn to transform into a bat and fly around to reach places that are otherwise inaccessible and even perhaps uncover new items. She also can transform into a mighty wolf, increasing movement speed and jumping ability, and colliding with enemies does not damage her while in wolf form.

It''s a expanded version of the old "freaky forms: your creations, alive!" with a dungeon, a all new power-up, and more parts! I like how they put four types of formees that you can make, which are: speedy, aggressive, defensive, and ???(Find out yourself!) It''s like rock, paper, scissors! I also like how you can fight against the guest formees in the dungeon. It''s a game that will make me never stop!    Also, the dungeon makes it like a adventure instead of nothing. Without this, there will be no action, it will just be a simple game without this. With the power-ups, it makes the game even funner! There''s like about 50 of them! They are useful when you go through the dungeons. Some of these power-ups you can use outside of a battle!    Finally, there''s the multiplayer game where you create formees with friends! Good thing we don''t need multiple copys of "freaky forms deluxe: your creations, alive!" The host will be able to pick a theme(the person who writes the theme is random!) or without a theme. You can also take pictures of the formees you and your friends made(with a qr code and a picture with all the formees!)    One thing I wished they added was if they added formee vs formee(player vs player) by doing wireless multiplayer. At least we could make it since the guest can be go against us in the dungeon!(player vs guest)'|E'https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/8/4a010915b69ce543ac0b45b525a5aada-98.jpg'|E'2020-11-29 22:10:41'
